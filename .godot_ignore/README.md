# Support your community!

this folder is ignored by Godot Editor, so any files stored here can be checked in to version control, but NOT clutter your workspace when doing development

this is a good place to add easy to access, extraneous resources for your fellow devs, such as:
- links to tutorials and resources
- links to third-party tools
- contact info for folks who are willing to help with questions/advice

([a project wiki](https://github.com/iznaut/a-little-game-called-mario/wiki) might be helpful too but i don't have as much experience with that!)

please use responsibly! all the same rules from the main project README apply here ðŸ’–
